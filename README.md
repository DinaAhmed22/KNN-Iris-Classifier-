# KNN-Iris-Classifier-
A machine learning project that implements and optimizes a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier on the Iris dataset. The model undergoes hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and learning curve analysis to achieve optimal performance.
📌 Features
✅ Loads the Iris dataset from Kaggle
✅ Preprocesses the data (label encoding & feature scaling)
✅ Performs hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search & Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation
✅ Trains and evaluates the KNN model with the best K-value
✅ Plots a learning curve to analyze train vs. test accuracy

📊 Technologies Used
Python 🐍
Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
Matplotlib (Data Visualization)
Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)
